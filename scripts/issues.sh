commands:
  labels sync [--prune] [--force] [--manifest FILE]
      Reconcile GitHub's labels against .github/labels.yml: create what is missing, edit what
      differs, report what is on the repo but not in the manifest. Orphans are only deleted
      with --prune, and --prune refuses to delete more than half the repo's labels without
      --force. A manifest that defines no labels is refused outright.

  sub add <parent> <child>
      Make issue <child> a sub-issue of issue <parent>.

  deps add <issue> --blocked-by <n>
      Record that <issue> is blocked by issue <n>.

  deps list <issue>
      What <issue> is blocked by: number, state and title, one per line.

  ready <issue>
      Run the five-rule Definition of Ready (MIP-0063 §5.4), naming the rule that failed, then
      add `agent-ready` on an all-pass and remove it when a previously-ready issue regressed.
      A `mip` proposal is not claimable work and is refused outright; a `bug` reads rules 1 and 2
      from bug_report.yml's own two fields.

  queue [--milestone NAME]
      The unassigned `agent-ready` issues, sorted size then priority, with a count of what is
      ready, blocked and still in triage. Those counts are derived from the labels and the
      dependency edges, not read from the board's Status field, which needs `project` scope.

options:
  --dry-run     print the mutating `gh` calls instead of making them (the reads they are
                computed from still happen, so this needs a login)
  --self-test   run the pure-function checks (parser, diff, plan, issue-form heading parse, the
                five DoR rules) plus the `ready`/`queue` commands against a stubbed `gh`; no
                network, but needs python3
  --help        this text

Live mode needs `gh` logged in. Inside ai-jail there is no login and none can be acquired
(AGENTS.md): run it from the host, or use --dry-run.

#     `add` *and* `orphan`: sync would abort on the failed create, and --prune would delete the
#     real label out from under every issue carrying it.
# `update` therefore carries `repo_name`, the spelling the label has today. That is the one the
# API can address: the same probe found DELETE case-*sensitive* on the path — deleting

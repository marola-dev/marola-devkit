commands:
  labels sync [--prune] [--force] [--manifest FILE]
      Reconcile GitHub's labels against .github/labels.yml: create what is missing, edit what
      differs, report what is on the repo but not in the manifest. Orphans are only deleted
      with --prune, and --prune refuses to delete more than half the repo's labels without
      --force. A manifest that defines no labels is refused outright.

options:
  --dry-run     print the mutating `gh` calls instead of making them (the repo's current
                labels are still read, so this needs a login)
  --self-test   run the pure-function checks (parser, diff, plan); no `gh`, no network
  --help        this text

Live mode needs `gh` logged in. Inside ai-jail there is no login and none can be acquired
(AGENTS.md): run it from the host, or use --dry-run.
